# multi_label_email_classification_main

## Overview
In this project we implemnt two models for multilabeled email classification.
1. *Chained Model* - Uses a sequence of models where each model predicts one label and passes relevant information to the next.
2. *Hierarchical Model* - Uses a hierarchical structure to predict labels, considering dependencies between them.

The system processes textual email data, encodes categorical features, applies TF-IDF vectorization, and trains models using machine learning techniques.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/SnehaMB/multi_label_email_classification_main
